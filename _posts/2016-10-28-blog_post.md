title: Murphy's Law
---

Today had Murphy's Law written all over it. Anything that could have went wrong today, went wrong. That's why I'm up at 2AM, exhausted, but wide awake. Thankfully, tomorrow is Friday. Although I'm sure I will not be as enthusiastic when I have to get up (and actually go into work for a change) in just a few hours.
